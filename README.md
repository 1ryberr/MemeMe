# What the application does.
> When the application launches it opens with a blank black background and two text fields.  One text field is labeled top and it is at the top center.  The other is labeled bottom and is on the bottom center. The toolbar has two buttons. One button is for going to the camera to take a photo and the other is for the photo library. After taking or choosing a photo of your liking, you may begin to make the meme. By tapping on the text field temporarily labeled top you are able to put any text onto the photo that you desire. You are able to do the same with the bottom text field. Once youâ€™re done you are able to save it to your photo library. It also displays your photos on a table and collection view.
